**Subagent Monitor for OpenCode.**

See what your subagents are doing without losing track of them: running, done, failed, elapsed time, and token/context usage when OpenCode exposes it.

This package works as a **TUI sidebar plugin** for OpenCode.

---

## Why?

When you delegate work to subagents, they can disappear into the background. That is powerful, but it also makes it easy to lose visibility:

- Is the review agent still running?
- Did the test agent finish?
- Which child session failed?
- How much context did a subagent use?

`opencode-subagent-statusline` adds a compact **Subagent Monitor** inside OpenCode so you can keep that information visible while you work.

## Install

Add the plugin to your OpenCode TUI config:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/tui.json",
  "plugin": ["opencode-subagent-statusline"]
}
```

Your TUI config usually lives at:

```txt
~/.config/opencode/tui.json
```

Restart OpenCode after editing the file.

---

## What you get

The TUI plugin adds a sidebar section that shows:

- running subagents
- completed subagents
- failed subagents
- elapsed time
- token/context usage when available

It also adds a small home/footer summary when there is active subagent activity.

## Keyboard navigation

Run `Subagents: Focus sidebar list` from the OpenCode command palette, or press
`Alt+B`, to focus the subagent sidebar list without using the mouse. List
navigation shortcuts are handled only while the sidebar list is focused.

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Alt+B` | Toggle focus between the subagent sidebar list and the prompt. |
| `j` / `ArrowDown` | Move selection to the next visible subagent. |
| `k` / `ArrowUp` | Move selection to the previous visible subagent. |
| `Enter` | Open the selected subagent session. |
| `h` / `ArrowLeft` | Collapse the subagent section. |
| `l` / `ArrowRight` | Expand the subagent section. |
| `Esc` | Leave list focus mode and return to the prompt. |

Opening a selected session is a no-op when there is no visible or navigable
subagent.

## Local development

Install dependencies:

```sh
pnpm install
```

Build the plugin:

```sh
pnpm build
```

Test the local TUI build by pointing OpenCode directly at `dist/tui.js`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/tui.json",
  "plugin": [
    "/absolute/path/to/sub-agent-statusline/dist/tui.js"
  ]
}
```

## Development notes

This project ships the OpenCode TUI sidebar plugin from `src/tui.tsx`.

The TUI bundle is built with `tsup` and `esbuild-plugin-solid` in Solid `universal` mode for OpenTUI compatibility.

Package entrypoints:

```txt
opencode-subagent-statusline          -> TUI plugin
opencode-subagent-statusline/tui      -> TUI plugin
```

Useful commands:

```sh
pnpm build
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm test:watch
pnpm test:coverage
pnpm pack --dry-run
```

## Testing

Automated tests use Vitest with `@vitest/coverage-v8`:

```sh
pnpm test
pnpm test:watch
pnpm test:coverage
pnpm typecheck
```

For the testing strategy, file map, examples, and current TUI/e2e boundaries, see
[`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md).

## Troubleshooting

### The plugin does not show up

Check OpenCode logs:

```sh
grep -n "subagent-statusline\|failed to load tui plugin" ~/.local/share/opencode/log/*.log
```

Then restart OpenCode after changing `tui.json`.

### I installed a new version but OpenCode still behaves like the old one

OpenCode may be using a cached package. Try clearing the cached package directory under:

```txt
~/.cache/opencode/packages/
```

Then restart OpenCode.

### Token/context usage is missing

OpenCode event payloads can vary by version and by event type. The plugin shows token/context usage when it is available and safely omits it when it is not.
